## Notes and Input Format:
  1. As of now it supports only the basic python operator like '+', '-', '*', '/', '%', '**' and bitwise operators such as '&', '|'.
  2. '^' is eqivalent to "power of function" or '**'.
  3. Absolute value can be found using both `abs()` and `| |`.
  4. Log has default value of base 10 and  cannot be changed for the time being.
  5. While using functions all the arguments should be inside paranthesis. Example, `sin x` should be written as `sin(x)`.
  6. Graphs can be plotted only against variable `x`.
  7. No need to write `y = `.
